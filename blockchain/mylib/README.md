# Gavivisha256  

Gavivisha256 is a custom cryptographic hash function inspired by SHA-256, implemented in C. It processes arbitrary input and produces a fixed 256-bit (32-byte) hash, ensuring data integrity and security. This project serves as an educational implementation of cryptographic hashing principles, including bitwise operations, message padding, and compression functions.  

## Features  

- **256-bit (32-byte) fixed-length hash output**  
- **Processes input in 512-bit blocks** for efficient computation  
- **Implements SHA-256-style padding and length encoding**  
- **Uses bitwise operations** (XOR, shifts, rotations) for mixing  
- **Optimized for correctness and readability**  

## Compilation  

You can compile `gavivisha256` using GCC:  

```sh
gcc -o gavivisha256 gavivisha256.c

This produces an executable named gavivisha256.

Usage

To generate a hash for a given input string, run:

./gavivisha256 "Hello, world!"

Example Output

Gavivisha256 hash: 3e23e8160039594a33894f6564e1b1348bbdf9f123f402a75b94b90f3d3c2a21

API Usage

If gavivisha256 is implemented as a library, you can use it in your C projects as follows:

#include "gavivisha256.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char *input = "Hello, world!";
    unsigned char hash[32];

    gavivisha256(input, hash);

    printf("Gavivisha256 hash: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
        printf("%02x", hash[i]);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

How Gavivisha256 Works
	1.	Padding the Input
	•	The input message is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits.
	•	Padding follows SHA-256 conventions, appending a 1 bit followed by 0s and encoding the original message length in the last 64 bits.
	2.	Message Scheduling
	•	The padded input is split into 512-bit blocks.
	•	Each block is expanded into a sequence of 32-bit words.
	3.	Compression Function
	•	A set of bitwise operations (XOR, shifts, rotations) and modular addition update the internal state.
	•	Each block is processed iteratively to mix entropy into the final hash.
	4.	Final Hash Output
	•	The final 256-bit (32-byte) digest is extracted from the internal state and returned as the hash.

TODO
	•	Optimize performance using hardware acceleration (SIMD, OpenSSL integration).
	•	Implement incremental hashing for large files instead of requiring full input in memory.
	•	Add test vectors to validate correctness against SHA-256.
	•	Support binary input for hashing raw data, not just strings.

Testing

To verify the correctness of gavivisha256, you can compare its output with known SHA-256 results for common inputs. Example test cases:

Input	Expected Output (SHA-256)
"abc"	ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
"" (empty string)	e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"	d7a8fbb307d7809469ca9abcb0082e4f8d5651e46d3cdb7625240e6fcf9aef3c

You can also use OpenSSL to validate:

echo -n "abc" | sha256sum
